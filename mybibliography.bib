  abstractNote = {OBJECTIVE: Lipedema is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that mainly affects women. It is characterized by excess deposition of subcutaneous adipose tissue,  pain,  and anxiety. The genetic and environmental etiology of lipedema is still largely unknown. Although considered a rare disease,  this pathology has been suggested to be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema. Steroid hormones seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of lipedema. Indeed,  aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1),  a gene coding for a protein involved in steroid hormones metabolism,  was the first proposed to be correlated with lipedema. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study,  we employed a molecular dynamics approach to assess the pathogenicity of AKR1C1 genetic variants found in patients with lipedema. Moreover,  we combined information theory and structural bioinformatics to identify AKR1C1 polymorphisms from the gnomAD database that could predispose to the development of lipedema. RESULTS: Three genetic variants in AKR1C1 found in patients with lipedema were disruptive to the protein’s function. Furthermore,  eight AKR1C1  variants found in the general population could predispose to the development of lipedema. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that AKR1C1 may be a key gene in lipedema pathogenesis,  and that common polymorphisms could predispose to lipedema development.},

  abstract = "Cellulite is an aesthetically distressing skin condition that
              manifests as dimples and depressions, producing an uneven surface
              to the skin. Occurring in 80\% to 90\% of females, mostly on the
              thighs, buttocks, and hips, it is associated with profound
              negative psychosocial and quality of life issues. Its
              ethiopathogenesis and pathophysiology are likely to be
              multifactorial and complex and not fully understood. There is no
              effective treatment for cellulite, although a number of different
              treatment modalities are available, from noninvasive to minimally
              invasive. The efficacy of most treatments is unpredictable and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Cellulite is a highly prevalent aesthetic condition
               in postpubertal women. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article
               was to describe the latest data on the pathophysiology of
               cellulite and to highlight the psychosocial aspects that should
               be considered when treating cellulite. METHODS: A roundtable
               meeting was convened to discuss and share views on the latest
               data on the pathophysiology and psychosocial aspects of
               cellulite. The participants' experience helped guide a narrative
               review on this topic. RESULTS: The pathophysiology of cellulite
               primarily involves fibrous septal changes. Strategies targeting
               the fibrous septa have shown the most consistent efficacy, while
               showing inconsistent or short-term results when targeting the
               other components of cellulite, such as decreased dermal
               thickness, vascular alterations, and inflammation. Female sex,
               increased age, and high body mass index contribute to cellulite
               pathophysiology. CONCLUSION: Patients seeking treatment for
               cellulite are willing to endure numerous treatments, high cost,
               temporary and/or delayed results, and invasive procedures with
               potential adverse effects. Psychological discomfort has been
               reported among patients with cellulite, and understanding their
               behaviors and psychological characteristics can help clinicians
               provide better care to these patients seeking treatment.",
